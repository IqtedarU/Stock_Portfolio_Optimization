# Stock_Portfolio_Optimization

This Is a Simple Project that is meant to learn the basics of portfolio optimization.

I go through my getting the data through yahoo finance, graphing, calculating log returns, standard deviation, covariance, and using it to optimize the portfolio. 

This also goes through Risk Management Using Historical VaR and Monte Carlos VaR.  

Future Ideas:
  - Graph Efficient Frontier
  - Data mine expected returns of stocks to use in the future by analyzing opinions of analysts
  - See how different factors affect portfolio(Time of year, ESG factors etc.). I am currently working on this by using new data i collect to create new optimization algorithms to see performance.
  - Data Mine Tickers with specific filters (P/E Ration, ESG Score etc)
